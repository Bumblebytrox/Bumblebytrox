- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bumblebytrox
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming. I play a ton of games, mostly survival though!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nodejs, json, html, css, javascript, and lua. I'm also learning how to create and use databases with mongodb and mysql.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on discord bots, minecraft projects, and databases!
- 📫 You can reach me on discord! 『Bumble』#0020
